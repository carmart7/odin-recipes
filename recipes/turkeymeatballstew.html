        <h3>Turkey Meatballs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound 93% lean ground turkey</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stew</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
            <li>3 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 cups cubed peeled potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup peeled, chopped carrots</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Coat a wire rack with nonstick cooking spray, set on prepared baking sheet, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, egg, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Using a 2-teaspoon cookie scoop, shape the mixture into 1-inch balls and place on the baking rack.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, chicken broth, potatoes, carrots, peas, basil, and red pepper flakes; stir until well combined. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes and carrots are cooked and the broth has somewhat reduced, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in meatballs and simmer until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Season stew with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
